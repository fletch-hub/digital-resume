    <p class="dropcap"><span class="relative top-[-0.5em]">M</span>y name is Eric Fletcher, and for the past 10 years
        I've
        designed, produced, and organized worldwide retail marketing campaigns for
        Microsoft's consumer product division—including the Windows, Surface,
        Microsoft 365, Xbox, and PC&nbsp;Accessory lines of business.</p>
    <p>
        The breadth and depth of my experience, coupled with a bit of talent,
        resourcefulness, and a compulsion for learning new things, has given me
        invaluable perspective and a uniquely rich skill set.</p>
    <p>
        I've modeled in-store Xbox displays for Best Buy, designed and developed
        interactive rich media banners for Windows, built responsive email templates
        for Microsoft 365, and designed bespoke marketing kits for social media
        influencers.</p>
    <p>
        I've redesigned and localized high-traffic websites into 26 different
        languages for as many markets, built an AI image program using open-source
        Stable Diffusion models, and invented a whole new way to build infinitely
        responsive HTML banners.</p>
    <p>
        My wheelhouse is big, but I've also learned the importance of operating
        within my purview, understanding when taking creative initiative is and
        isn't appropriate, and accepting feedback with an open mind.</p>
    <p>
        I've managed a team as large as 7, and I've produced entire digital
        campaigns on my own, but I also enjoy being a humble contributor in a team
        setting. I'm an excellent communicator, and I'm not afraid to ask questions!
        I'm here for new challenges and look forward to learning about yours.
