# Info

I built this site using Vite, Tailwind, Handlebars, and vanilla JavaScript.

### Todos

- There are redirects set up in the toml file for the purposes of url-shortening and analytics tracking. Manually hashed these routes. TODO: Write a script to do this automatically

- organize css better

- Need to go through and add arias, accessibility features, etc

- Dark mode toggle?
